    <h3>I'll love to tell you a little about my journey in software engineering.</h3>
    <!-- <p>So I was asked to use about 20 different html tags on this webpage, at this moment I've used 10 html tags</p> -->
    <ul>
        <li>Through a whatsapp-mentored program for females, I got introduced into coding. I started with HTML and CSS, learnt about them from <b>Head first with HTML & CSS</b>. I'm a really slow learner, so it took me a while to finsih the textbook. After that, I got a few recommendations on materials I can use to learn Javascript. Finally, I bought a course on udemy, <i>WEB DEVELOPER BOOTCAMP</i></li>
        <li>I rushed through the beginning part since i was quite familiar with them and then bang, I started learning how to program in JS. As expected it was not a smooth journey especialy with my weakness of slow learning.</li>
        <li>I also had a challenge with doing my own personal projects for practice, I worked on it and did a few projects which I didnt even push to github, unfortunately I had issues with my system and lost several of them. After being comfortable with Javascript, I read about the different javascript frameworks and picked up ReactJS.</li>
        <li>I reacted <s>negatively</s> to REACTjs. I found it really hard to understand, reached out to a few gurus and it still was not working for me. I kept playing around it till July 2018 when I saw an opportunity to join Data Svience Ife team and participate in a kaggle competiton. </li>
        <li>I researched about it and I found out I had so much more interest in it, probably because I loved statistics as a subject. I followed up my interest by taking a course on EDX, <strong>Introduction to Data Science</strong>. I practiced on datacamp's website and was loving the course. Though I did not get to particpate in the competition because I had not fioinished the required courses by then, still I continued my learning and moved on to an Advanced data Science course on Udacity, I'm currently on it and I've done several mini tasks in the process of learning while I am also working on a SKINEO model project.</li>
        <h4>I look forward to being a Data scientist Guru, see you all at the top, CHEERS and thanks for reading through.</h4>
